<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p> When I started writing about this journey, I initially started from week 0 of the course, however, one of my main learnings so far is that things don't really start where you think they start: they have a context and a past. So I decided to start a little earlier. On the other side of the world, in Mexico City. </p>

<div class="diagrams">

</div>

<p>This city is full with culture and trees, and looking at it from a distance, growing up there has had a big influence in what I am curious about today. The mixture of the ancient with the modern, the rich with the poor and the natural with the artificial has influenced me in a ways that I am now only beginning to understand. As I reflect upon my learning journey, I realize that not acknolwedging it would make for an incomplete charactrization.</p>

<h3>T-x days.</h3>

To much of my parents and friends surprise, I left my job at Google after two years. I started working there full-time a few months before finishing college. As comfortable as it was, I never truly felt passionate about my job. I worked in digital ads and always felt that there are far more interesting things that can be done with technology. That was exactly the idea behind what I founded a few years earlier: <a href="http://www.datalabitam.com/">Datalab ITAM</a>, an undergraduate lab that uses data science for social good. It grew from a two friends' idea into a lab that now has an office and is supported  by the Engineering department. Every year, an interdiscplinary group of undergraduate students joins the lab and works in a variaty of projects. The last one I worked there, which was also my undegrad thesis, was an art installation that used machine learning to bring attention to the issue of mass dissapreances in Mexico, by showing visitors a missing person similar to them.

<div class="diagrams">

<p>A user being shown a very similar missing person to him </p>
</div>
 That project planted the roots for my learning journey in Australia, as I became interested in the interactions between technology, art and people. I handed my thesis, and a few days later, I jumped in a plane to the other side of the world, where I became a master's student at the 3Ai institute.

<h3>Cybernetic Dream</h3>

In many ways, this whole experience has felt like a dream. First of all, it has been marked by the pandemic lockdown. I have spent a lot of time alone, in a new country, alterning between the Canberra's greenness and my computer screen. Everything seems new and often I feel like I stepped out from reality into a dimension where my sole purpose is to learn. 
<br>
<br>
One of the key learning experiences has been one of my two courses at the 3Ai Institue, the Fundamentals of a New Science Lab, which we called Build. Here, I have been guided by an amazing group of tutors as I develop my skills towards becoming a practicioner of a new kind of engineering, which by the way, is being created as it is being taught. What is this new branch of engineering, you ask? Nobody knows yet, but so far, my best take at a one sentence summary is: "things are always more complicated than you think". Everything exists across different domains and have different dimensions. We focus on technological systems and particularly a subset called cyberphysical ones. These are systems of networked computers that sense and control physical processes, with feedback loops between them. Self driving cars, smart electrical grids and ecological monitoring sort of stuff. But they are not only made of wires and circuits, they interact with systems across technical, social, political, ecological and ethical espectrums, to name a few. 
<br>
<br>
How do we unpack this complexity? Fortunately, we are not the first ones to ask this question. A man named Norbert Wiener, a fellow mexican Arturo Ronseblueth and many others got together in the 40's and came up with a few ideas. What resulted became the foundation of what they called cybernetics. You have probably heard the word, and you probably understand it as something very different from the actual definition. Cybernetics aims to study the world a set of interconnected complex systems, with feedback loops that give rise to the emergence of complex behavior. These systems are everywhere: our physiology, water processes in the biosphere or the internet are all examples of cybernetic processes. They exist anywhere where there is a form of control and feedback machanism. The rise of artificial intelligence opens the door to a completely new class of system: autonomous digital computers that control the physical world around us: cities, ecosystems and our bodies. These are the systems that we focus on at 3Ai.
<br>
<br>
A good way to study cyberphysical systems is to build them. But we start small, by developing skills. Tutors guide us through fortnightly projects while we are also given freedom to direct our own journey. Therefore, every student has a different one. This is mine. 

<h3> Musical experiments </h3>

One type of system that I am very interested in is autonomous music generation. We can imagine a system that autonomously composes music, optimizing towards personalized user preferences. For that, it a way to acquire user's feedback. At first it can be an intentional signal, like a button, but in the future, it could sense the user's brains dopamine levels. In both cases, the user and the system influence each other in an intricate loop that exists across domains like biology, mathematics, culture, power and data.

<br>
<br>

 For the course's final semester project, I set out to build a basic prototype of an automatic music generator. My objective was to create some sort of experience in the browser that would generate music based on user's feedback. Therefore, I had to learn a bunch of stuff. First, I started with music theory. I already played a bit of piano, guitar and drums, but I never really knew the theory of everything I was playing. My introduction this Andrew Huang video, which is an amazing 30 minute music theory crash course. That gave me the base to start learning more on my own through different online resources. I also looked at Adam Nelly's great content and was inspired by this talk where he talks about the mathematical properties of consonance and shows relationships in the visual domain. This planted the seed for my interest in adding a visual component to my prototype. I even applied my music theory learning into making an actual song, which I wrote, recorded. It received very good feedback from my friends so I recently uploaded to Spotify (Yes, that is a photo from one of my many Canberra bicycle rides and I made up a nom de plume).

 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
 

<h3> Musical Cybernetics </h3>
 The second step was to learn how to make music with code. I learned about the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard in detail.

 I also started exploring the creation of music using code. I initially focused on Python. My exploration was a bit messy but very fun. I documented most of it in this <a href="https://github.com/rodolfoocampo/la_zona/blob/master/Hearing%2C%20feeling%20and%20computing.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a></h4></li> 

 <br>
 <br>
<iframe clas="diagrams" src="hearing.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<br>
 <br>
 This exploration also had the intention of increasing my level in this coding language, which was achieved.

After that, I learned about magenta, an open source project by Google which contains the state of the art machine learning models for music generation. I read around 50% of Alexandre DuBreuil's great book Hands-On Music Generation with Magenta. Initially, I played with the Python library, but since I am interested in creating a web experience for my prototype, I moved to the Javascript API, also covered in the book. With that knowledge, I created this AI Radio, which generates endless, never repeating songs. 

<br><br>
<div class="container" style='border-style: solid';>

  <h3>AI RADIO</h3>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="start()">Start music</button> Endless stream of real-time computer-generated retro-futuristic chiptune music. It's all generated here, in your browser, uniquely for you, using a neural network called variational autoencoder.
<div class="slidecontainer">

  <p id='bpm_label'> <p id='tempo'> Adjust BPMs</p> </p>
  <input type="range" onchange="setTempo(document.getElementById('bpm_range').value)" min="60" max="140" value="100" class="slider" id="bpm_range">
</div>
<button class="btn btn-danger" onclick="stop()">Stop music</button>
<br>
</br> 
</div>
<br>
Here, the only "feedback" received by the user is the adjustment of tempo. It is still very primitive, but it was a good first step.

<br>
<br>


<h3> Browser Experiments </h3>

This led me to tinker around with javascript more and explore its possibilities for fun interactions in the browser. I created a few web experiments that explore some cybernetic concept, like randomness, agency, initial conditions, feedback loops and entropy. 

 Try the experiments below!

<br>
<div class="container" style='border-style: solid';>
<h4>Color experiment </h4> 
<h5>Concepts: randomness, agency, initial conditions </h5> 

<p id = 'intro'>

  If you tap the screen or over move your mouse around, you will see that the color changes accordingly. Try to find your favorite. 
  </br>
  </br> 
  <strong>You will start to notice patterns, </strong> but you will also notice that your options are limited. One of the three components that determine a color was set randomly and remains fixed. The other two can be manipulated with the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> coordinates of your screen tap or cursor. 

  </br>
  </br>
  <strong>But wait! </strong> You can roll the dice again to change your fixed variable for a new random number. If you want to find your favorite color, when will you decide to reroll vs. stay with your options? How do you navigate between randomness and agency? 

  </br>
  </p>
  </br>


<button type="button" onclick="dice()" class="btn btn-primary">Roll the dice</button>
</br>
<p>
</br>
</div>


</br> 
<div class="container" style='border-style: solid';>
<h4>The taco game experiment!</h4>
<h5>Concepts: feedback loops, reward mechanisms</h5>

<p>Press the following button and the word "taco" will be randomly inserted somewhere in the text. If you find one, click it to earn a point. It's hard, but don't desist! The victory high is worth it. </p>

<button id = 'taco'type="button" onclick="insertTaco()" class="btn btn-primary">Insert taco</button>
</br> 
<p id = 'taco_score'></p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>
 This game illustrates how our dopamine reward system is closely coupled with to our ability to distinguish signal from noise. Here, my website's text is the noise and the taco is your signal. 

I suspect that such a signal-reward mechanism is closely related to our enjoyment of music and that what I am exploring in my Algorithmic music composer project at the 3Ai. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/rodolfoocampo/la_zona/blob/master/Hearing%2C%20feeling%20and%20computing.ipynb">Jupyter notebook </a> I told you earlier about where I will be doing most of my exploration. </p>
</br> 
</div>

</br> 
<div class="container" style='border-style: solid';>
<h4>The chaotic taco game!</h4>
<h5>Concepts: feedback loops, reward mechanism, randomness, chaos, entropy</h5>

<p>
 Same game, but now the website text will be random nonsense blob of characters, except for the word 'taco'. Is finding the taco easier? Is it more rewarding? Well, I don't know. This is experimental, OK?</p>


<button id='chaos'type="button" onclick="chaos()" class="btn btn-primary">Unleash Taco Chaos</button> <p display='none'>  
  </br> 
</div>

<h3>Putting it into action</h3>

I put some of the skills showcased above into action for one of our assignments, where we were tasked with building a data visualization. I chose to add a sonic component to use a new library that I started learning, Tone.js. My intention was to question our visual relationship with data. After moving into cities, now that acute hearing and smell is not a crucial tool for survival, did we lose our ability to understand the world through non-visual information? 
What do we lose when approaching the world only with one sense? This experiment can be found at https://musicalize-data.herokuapp.com/ or you can play with it directly below
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 
I then came across p5.js, a great tool for creating visual art in the browser, developed by Lauren McCarthy. My main learning resource was THE AMAZING p5.js course by Daniel Shiffman. Seriously, I cannot stress enough how good his YouTube Channel is, The Coding Train.

P5.js was my main resource is what I used for my final project a musical automata, which is a complete working prototype of a music generating system in the browser that receives user feedback. Through the last month, as I learned abiut cybernetics and complex system, I became fascinated by cellular automata: a simple mathematical system where cells in a grid interact with each other according to some simple initial rules, at sequential time steps. Some people believe that the Universe itself is a cellular automata, and that you could simulate any system with them. 

True or not, cellular automata exhibit interesting cybernetic properties. Complexity emerges from simple initial conditions. Feedback loops are formed, even though they are not explicityely programmed. If cellular automata are visualized, they can exhibit beautiful visual patterns. So, for my prototype, I wondered if I could use a cellular automata to generate music and visual art, starting from initial user defined conditions and rules of interaction, right in the browser. The user could change conditions at any point, or rules, and the behavior of the automaton would change. 

You can play with the project here or go to directly to <a href="https://musical-automata.glitch.com/">https://musical-automata.glitch.com</a>

<h3> New possibilities </h3>

This prototype achieves my initial goal of creating a generative music system that receives feedback from a user. However, I believe the music component is still far from being something enjoyable. In contrast, I believe that the visual one is much more interesting. 

I also think that beyond art generation, my prototype could be used as an educational tool for teaching cellular automata, cybernetics and complex systems. At the time of writing this, I have not found a single browser based tool for exploring cellular automata, so my hope is to share it with the academic community.

<h3> Beyond cybernetic art: other learnings </h3>

 One of the other main topics I explored was artificial intelligence. I created a Tic Tac Toe playing agent using the minimax algorith and created aa Jupyter tutorial on how to make one.

 <iframe src="tictutorial.html" style="width: 100%; height:500px"></iframe>

The last one I one to show you did not involved coding but consisted in mapping AI research. I had an amazing resource: a list of seminal AI papers curated by the tutors. I went on to map its relationship by doing further investigation, more or less assigning each paper to a particular aspect of AI and tried to create a coherent map that would let the viewer get a somehow complete picture of how AI research has looked like, from its early beginnings to today. Of course, this map is incomplete, and knowledge cannot be neatly divided in discrete branches. I have also left a lot of important papers. However, I think this is a good start and could be a useful resource for the AI students.

<h3>Next steps</h3>

Where do I go from here?
<h2>Final reflections</h2>

Personal learning is a cybernetic system.

</br>

I started exploring out of sheer curiosity, which generated a feedback loop of reward in my brain and led me to explore certain direction, however, this feedback process was influenced by another: the Questions course, who also les me to intellectualy explore other areas and use creative mediums to question systems. These two, were themselves were influenced by the many areas in which we focused each fortnight during the course. The COVID pandemic, probably one of the most complex systems in the world right now, also had a huge influence of my learning. It put me in isolation during my first months in a new country. It gave me opportunity to pause and think more deeply about topics that interest me.

</div>
  <marquee>The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite,
perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries. In the center of each gallery
is a ventilation shaft, bounded by a low r,ailing. From any hexagon one can
see the floors above and below-one after another, endlessly. The arrangement of the galleries is always the same: Twenty bookshelves, five to each
side, line four of the hexagon's six sides; the height of the bookshelves, floor
to ceiling, is hardly greater than the height of a normal librarian. One of the
hexagon's free sides opens onto a narrow sort of vestibule, which in turn
opens onto another gallery, identical to the first-identical in fact to all.
To the left and right of the vestibule are two tiny compartments. One is
for sleeping, upright; the other, for satisfying one's physical necessities.
Through this space, too, there passes a spiral staircase, which winds upward
and downward into the remotest distance. In the vestibule there is a mirror,
which faithfully duplicates appearances. Men often infer from this mirror
that the Library is not infinite-if it were, what need would there be for that
illusory replication? I prefer to dream that burnished surfaces are a figuration and promise of the infinite ... . Light is provided by certain spherical
fruits that bear the name "bulbs." There are two of these bulbs in each hexagon, set crosswise. The light they give is insufficient, and unceasing. </marquee>
